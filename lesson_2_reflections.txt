What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans:	When git init is launch we create a new git repository where can link our project to git and handle it,
And even launch it whether it be any nay programming language. and we also need to know how many file and what 
file are there, it can be general file and even secret file.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans:	When ever init is done in git its done of any file, it is done in resporitoy using "git init".
After the initialised is done of file in git file is to be add or creat so that is done in directory initially 
it is done using "git add" command in git, and to know the status of the directory we use "status" which show us 
what are the file which we have updated recently and make new or changes in file with time and date.
